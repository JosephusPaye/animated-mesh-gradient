# Make a Mesh

Generate animated mesh gradients and export as video. [Try it here](https://makeamesh.netlify.app).

## To-do

- [ ] Show the recording status (e.g. progress in terms of amount of frames or seconds done, or amount left)
- [ ] Allow for configuring the number of seconds to record, and the auto save interval in the UI
- [ ] Make it more robust with the little things (e.g. sync the `capturer` recording state to the app's recording state)
- [ ] Find a way to destroy old Gradient instances when generating new ones due to color or seed changes
